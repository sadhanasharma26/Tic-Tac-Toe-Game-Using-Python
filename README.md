# TIC TAC TOE Game
The early Roman version was known as terni lapilli, or three pebbles at a time. In the mid-1800s, Britain used the name noughts and crosses, with nought referring to the O’s (or zeros) used in the game. The phrase tick-tack-toe wasn’t used until the late 1800s, and there’s some findings that report it might have been used to describe a completely different game.
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

# Procedure
I have created a class named **Board**.
In the main function of class, I have initialised the attribute called cells in which we have initialised blank board.
Created a function named display and printed the board.
I have created a function called update_cells which is used to update the board after each input taken.
There is a function called win_check in which we can get to know the winner whether it is X or O by checking each and every cells after each user input.
If the player choose to restart the game he/she can do that and the board will be reset.
I will start with the X’s turn, he/she will put the position between 1-9 then the update_cell function will update the board and display the board. Now, O Player will play his/her turn then the updated cells will be displayed. Win_Check function is checked every time when the user input is taken for each turn. If someone has won the game then the game will come to an end and ask the user for playing again.
